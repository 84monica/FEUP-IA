Supervised learning: (steps)
    1 - dataset analysis to check for the need for data pre-processing,
    2 - identification of the target concept,
    3 - definition of the training and test sets, 
        - cross validation
        - 80% of the data in the training set, 10% in the validation set, and 10% in the test set 
    4 - selection and parameterization of the learning algorithms to employ,
    5 - evaluation of the learning process (in particular on the test set).
